<p>Hello there. My name is Kaedi Urey, a sophomore at Walsh University. I am currently studying Graphic Design and Game Design at my university. I'm currently a part-time employee at Staples, as well.</p>
<p id="second">Outside of school, my hobbies are playing video games and teaching myself how to utilize AI for fun. I've been playing games ever since I was little, starting with Super Mario all the way to Playstation games. Other than playing games, I use AI for some things just for fun. I use it to create characters, art, and I use it to help come up with ideas for characters that I create for stories I would like to make later in the future.</p>
